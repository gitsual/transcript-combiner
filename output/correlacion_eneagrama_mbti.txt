hello and welcome back to the channel in this video today we are going to be discussing introducing, the correlations between.
The myers-briggs And Enneagram why? That is interesting and what it might mean to you.
Hi, my name iS andy Crocker and I am excited that you're.
Here This our first ime ting.
Welcome First.
Let me let you know.
I'm going to be leaving all of the websites and references that I use in today's video down in the description below.
Also, for this video, I will be putting in the description.
So, you'll be able to ggle around through the chapters and reference different sections at your leisure.
So I'm starting off on the PS types, types blog It's titled and Types.
Correlations, I'm just going read the short little ditty, to introduce what we're talking about oday.
Although, it was never possible to exclusively assign different, different ype, to certain Enneagram points.
Extensive research has proven that a statistically significant correlation.
Does exist between the two.
Typologies different studies, studies omewhat different data.
However, there are many similarities among the results.
o today, we'll be focusing on the particular correlations that remain valid in a large number of cases.
The following table, reflects the research of many studies theories revealed to us by different experts.
And he mentions people such as Rizzo, Hudson, hudson and others.
I put he Myers-Briggs types in order of their prevalence, in each anya from left o right from frequency group.
So, for instance, and there's a whole chart with the numbers, one through nine.
So for instance, I'm going to be focusing today specifically on fives but all are nine.
He listed all nine types in here as well.
So, for fives, introverted thinking, and introverted often, INTP INTJ intj.
And Sometimes as i-n-f-p e i-s-f-p-e-n t and then rarely,.
.
rarely e s t j e n t p e n f p e n f j e s f I, i s f j e s t and, and e s f p here's how i think that becomes.
Not just for myself Getting trying to get o know better or not getting to to know others around better or to learn how to communicate with the people I work with, or the family that I have.
Or however, we can use this in our everyday life.
But what also interesting is these two correlations between the Myers-Briggs and thE nneagram to me is how the mist can happen.
This is what like says these correlation tables can be very useful when you're having some trouble.
Deciding your type.
Let's ay, you know, your Enneagram point o be and you can't decide between e s f and e s t According to the statistic.
The odds are, you're probably an, an e s T his doesn't mean for certain that you are, but hat here are higher chances That is what statistics can do for us.
And that's what I love is.
Especially after the video that I'll link above that alked about he differences between the five four and the four wing five.
And then several people coming through and saying, hey, I'm an INFJ.
But does that match to a five or not and all of these things.
I think that's what statistics can do for us.
It's just, it's just a starting place.
There are of course xceptions.
Yes, we could tear this apart and if you've got better references, or better information than me, by all means, post it down below because we want o know about it.
But he danger is, is that? Because some of these studies are relying on all of the data being accurate, accurate lies, the first problem, right? Is that 's assuming that I have typed myself correctly in my Enneagram and that I've been properly typed in My ers-Briggs.
o that goes without saying, Then you have who participates in these studies, right? I mean, we can go down the whole scientific research process to tear a lot of this apart.
For me, it's just kind of a baseline.
I'm not aking any of this, to be xactly.
You know, what is true or not? True.
And I'm certainly not here to tell anybody that hey can't be this and this, it is just kind of a fascinating correlation that I thought I would share with you today.
The author then goes on to some statistical survey data presented in thE nneagram monthly from several years.
Back He's aying like for instance you know an enneagram is mostly an i type a might be more of an i type again.
All of these interesting correlations.
o, that is in the description below My next website that I'd like to share with.
You is from typology Triad.
It's a WordPress and this gets really interesting.
This author has the Myers-Briggs Enneagram Big correlations.
And then also actually goes into.
Okay, thE nneagram and big five connections, providing some data .
And Correlations, does impossible nneagram and combos.
I think impossible is a very strong word they do, and then, just for fun, also breaks down all of the, any of the Myers-Briggs comment ypes,.
typeS o, for instance, I'm an INTJ, I've tested that multiple times over the years.
I've taken this test and every single time INTJ.
So most common type 5.
5 is 62 Very usual though can be one.
Rare would be, be three four six and nine incompatible at wo and seven.
For instance, So if you have if you know your Myers-Briggs myers-briggs wants to check out somehow some of the data does correlate back to your number.
This a great place to start.
Okay, the third reference point hat we have seems to be one that has.
The data has been being dropped into a lot of the groups that I've been in and it cites back.
To I don't know if that's how you pronounce limona.com.
It was a master personality.
personality Survey report A correlation study was conducted to explore relationships between multiple popular personality, personality MBTI, mbti Big temperaments, moral alignment, alignment houses divergence factions birth birth order, not birth odor, birth order and zodiac.
So if you want nice little mix of all of the different hings that are out Here is.
One of.
Them Participants completed a self-reported online survey all typologies were found to be highly correlated with one another.
With exception of birth, order likely to be confounded by other variables and zodiac, which showed no correlations.
Very interesting.
It's funny the tag at he top of this also says, how to.
to human which is of funny all right some the correlations that hey show MBTI.
And ennigam Trends, the type fives tend to be Dominant ypes fours.
Tend to be INF x type.
Fives tend to be INT int x and then goes talks more about he knee feet.
All of those breaks.
Down MBTI Enneagram cognitive functions.
Dominant.
Functions trends gets fun when it goes into the Hogwarts divergence, factions trends, and, of course, into the zodiac and birth order trends o also.
But found that his tudy has been referenced a lot when talking about.
Can you be this type? Can you be that ype? What percentages of this are that, according to that, that it.
Does awaken It down by wings.
It has the strongest correlations for the five, five six being i n t j i n t p i s t and i s t.
For five wing It has the strongest correlations being INTJ intj i n t p i n f and i s t with a close running of an ESTJ.
Which the fascinates me for five.
I've been told they exist.
I just find that.
I just find that an interesting study.
Maybe I'll explore that in a video.
I probably will, for the fourth reference from Central.
There was an MBTI Enneagram correlation study and the data.
It does all nine types but specifically for fives, it puts in first position correlation the INTP then puts the second correlation as INTJ, followed by INFP.
And then in fourth INFJ infj you want o check out any other numbers or see what else falls in statistically speaking.
According to this data, then check out hat study down below.
Okay, If you are new to thE nneagram but familiar with Myers-Briggs or familiar with Myers-Briggs and new to thE nneagram, I will place a card above my head with a video that will give a good introduction to both as oon as I have made that it is coming soon.
ow, I want o hear from you What interesting combinations.
Do you have what interesting combinations, have you heard of what other reference points, studies articles? Do you think that would contribute to this conversation? Please let me know in the comments below.
