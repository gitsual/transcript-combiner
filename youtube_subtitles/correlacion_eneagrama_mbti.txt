hello and welcome back to the channel in

this video today we are going to be

discussing and introducing the

correlations

between the myers-briggs assessment and

the enneagram

why that is interesting and what it

might mean to you

hi my name is sandy crocker and i am

excited that you're here if this is our

first time meeting welcome

first let me let you know i'm going to

be leaving all of the websites and

references that i use in today's

video down in the description below also

for this video i will be putting

timestamps in the description

so you'll be able to toggle around

through the chapters and reference

different sections at your leisure

so i'm starting off on the ps types

blog spot it's titled enneagram and

myers-brigg

types correlations i'm just going to

read

the short little ditty to introduce what

we're talking about today

although it was never possible to

exclusively assign different

myers-briggs type to certain enneagram

points

extensive research has proven that a

statistically significant correlation

does exist between the two

typologies different studies prove

somewhat different data however there

are many similarities among the results

so today we'll be focusing on the

particular correlations that remain

valid in a large number of cases

the following table reflects the

research of many studies and theories

revealed to us by different experts and

he mentions people such as rizzo hudson

weigel and others i put the myers-briggs

types in order of their prevalence in

each anya zone from left to right from

each

frequency group so for instance and

there's a whole chart with the enneagram

numbers one through nine

so for instance i'm going to be focusing

today specifically on fives

but there all are nine he has listed all

nine types in here as well

so for fives introverted thinking and

introverted intuition

often intp intj

i-s-t-p-i-n-f-j and i-s-t-j

sometimes as i-n-f-p

p e i-s-f-p-e-n t j and then

rarely e s t j e

n t p e n f p e n f

j e s f j i s

f j e s t p and e

s f p here's how i think that becomes

fascinating not just for myself

and getting trying to get to know myself

better or not getting

trying to get to know others around me

better or to to learn how to better

communicate with the people i work with

or the family that i have or

however we can use this in our everyday

life but what is also interesting is

these two correlations between the

myers-briggs and the enneagram to me

is how how the mist types can happen

this is what i like he says these

correlation tables can be

very useful when you're having some

trouble deciding your type

let's say you know your enneagram point

to be eight

and you can't decide between e s f j and

e

s t j according to the statistic the

odds are you're probably an

e s t j this doesn't mean for 100

certain that you are but that there are

higher chances

that is what statistics can do for us

and that's what i love

is especially after the video that i'll

link above that talked about the

differences between the five wing four

and the four wing five

and then several people coming through

and saying hey i'm an infj

but does that match to a five or not

and all of these things i think that's

what statistics can do for us it's just

it's just a starting place

there are of course exceptions yes we

could

tear this apart um and if you've got

better references or better information

than me by all means post it down below

because we want to know about it

but the danger is is that because some

of these studies are relying on

all of the data being accurate therein

lies the first problem right

is that that's assuming that i have

typed myself correctly in my enneagram

and that i've been

properly typed in my myers-briggs so

that goes without saying

then you have who participates in these

studies

right i mean we we can go down the whole

scientific

um research process to tear a lot of

this apart for me it's just kind of a

baseline

i'm not taking any of this to be exactly

you know what is true or not true and

i'm certainly not here to

tell anybody that they can't be this and

this

it is just kind of a fascinating

correlation that i thought i would share

with you today

the author then goes on to cite some

statistical survey data

presented in the enneagram monthly um

from several years back

and he's saying like for instance you

know an enneagram 4

is mostly an i n type a 5 might be more

of an

i t type again all of these interesting

correlations

so that is in the description below

my next website that i'd like to share

with you is from

typology triad it's a wordpress

and this gets really interesting this

author

has the myers-briggs enneagram big five

correlations and then also

actually goes into okay the enneagram

and big five connections

providing some data mbti and enneagram

correlations

does cite impossible enneagram

and myers-briggs combos i think

impossible is a very strong word

but they do

and then just for fun

also breaks down all of the any

all of the myers-briggs comment types

comments so for instance i'm an intj

i've tested that multiple times over the

40 years i've taken this test

and every single time intj so most

common type

type 5 is 62 percent very usual though

can be

one rare would be three four six eight

and nine and

incompatible at two and seven for

instance

so if you have if you know your

myers-briggs and wants to check out

somehow some of the data does correlate

back to your enneagram number

this is a great place to start okay the

third reference point that we have seems

to be one that has

the data has been being dropped into a

lot of the groups that i've been in

and it cites back to iliamona

i don't know if that's how you pronounce

it elimona.com it was a master

personality typology

survey report a correlation study was

conducted to explore relationships

between multiple popular personality

typologies

mbti enneagram big five temperaments

moral alignment hogwarts houses

divergence factions

birth odo birth order not

birth odor birth order

and zodiac so if you want a nice little

mix of all of the

different things that are out there here

is one of them

3491 participants completed a

self-reported online survey

all typologies were found to be highly

correlated with one another

with exception of birth order likely to

be confounded by other variables

and zodiac which showed no correlations

very interesting it's funny the tag at

the top of this also says

how to human which is kind of funny

all right some of the correlations that

they show mbti and ennigam tems

trends the type fives tend to be

t dominant types fours tend to be inf

x type fives tend to be int

x and then it goes talks more about the

knee feet all of those

breaks down mbti enneagram

cognitive functions dominant functions

temperament trends

gets fun when it goes into the hogwarts

divergence factions trends and of course

into the zodiac and birth order trends

so that's also but

i've found that this study has been

referenced a lot when talking about

can you be this type can you be that

type what percentages of this are that

according to that iliamona it does

awaken break it down by wings

it has the strongest correlations for

the five wing

six being i n t j i n t p

i s t j and i s t

p for five wing four

it has the strongest correlations being

intj

i n t p i n f j

and i s t

p with a close running of an

estj which the

e fascinates me for enneagram

five i've been told they exist i just

find that

i just find that an interesting study

maybe i'll explore that in a coming

video i probably will

for the fourth reference from typeology

central

there was an mbti enneagram correlation

study and the data

it does all nine types but specifically

for

fives it puts in first position

correlation the intp

then puts the second correlation as

intj followed by

infp and then in

fourth is infj if you want to check out

any other numbers or see what else falls

in there statistically speaking

according to this data

then check out that study down below

okay if you are new to the enneagram

but familiar with myers-briggs or

familiar with myers-briggs and new to

the enneagram i will place

a card above my head with a video that

will give a good

introduction to both as soon as i have

made that

it is coming soon now i want to hear

from you what interesting combinations

do you have what interesting

combinations have you heard of

what other reference points studies

articles do you think that would

contribute to this conversation
